# <Password Generator>
## Description
Homework 3 is all about javascript. my task was to write the javascript for a password generator; html and css already provided.
## Installation
Writing the javascript was tough for me. I had to really depend on google and past classwork to get through this. I have to admit, I did restart towards the end of my first try because i just could nto get the generator to work. I figured that it might be easier to restart instead of trying to debug the code. psuedocode was very helpful as well to get things rolling.
## Usage
